# Deolang

A two-dimensional esoteric programming language.

Created by Deolta and Sylv1an.

## About

Deolang is an esoteric programming language where the code is placed on a two-dimensional grid. An instruction pointer moves across this grid, executing the commands it encounters.

The language is stack-based and includes a variety of commands for:
*   Arithmetic and logic
*   Stack manipulation
*   Memory control (Heap)
*   I/O operations
*   Flow control through mirrors, jumps, and function calls

## IDE & Debugger

This project comes with a built-in IDE and debugger.

### Features
*   Code editor with syntax highlighting.
*   Live visualization of the main stack, auxiliary stack, and heap memory.
*   Controls to run, step through, stop, and reset the program.
*   Adjustable execution speed.
*   An output window to see the program's results.
*   A handy in-app cheatsheet for all commands.

### How to Run
To launch the IDE, run the `debugger.py` file or use `debugger.exe`:
```bash
python debugger.py
```
